            <p>What is Frontend Development?

                Frontend development is the part of web development that focuses on what users see and interact with on
                a website. It includes designing and building the layout, buttons, forms, colors, animations, and
                overall user interface.

                A frontend developer uses technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to turn designs into real, working
                web pages. The goal is to make websites responsive, fast, and easy to use on all devices such as
                mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

                Good frontend development is not only about looks — it’s about user experience. A well-built frontend
                makes a website attractive, smooth, and enjoyable for users.

                In short, frontend development connects design with functionality and plays a key role in creating
                modern, professional websites.</p>
            <h3>rule-base-chatbot-development</h3>
            <p>Rule-based chatbots are designed to respond to users based on predefined rules, conditions, and
                workflows. These chatbots follow logical paths such as if-else rules to provide accurate and consistent
                responses.

                I develop rule-based chatbots that are ideal for customer support, lead generation, FAQs, and business
                automation. They help businesses handle common queries efficiently without the need for human
                intervention.

                My chatbot solutions are structured, reliable, and easy to use. Each chatbot is customized according to
                business requirements, ensuring smooth conversation flow and a better user experience.

                Rule-based chatbots are cost-effective, fast, and perfect for businesses that want automated
                communication with clear and controlled responses.</p>
